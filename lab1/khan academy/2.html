            <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
            There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            <em>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</em><br>
            <strong>Slowly. Surely.</strong> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
            Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
            <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
            <em>It’s not that you don’t get it.</em><br>
            You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong><br>
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
            <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
